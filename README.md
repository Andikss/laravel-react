Laravel is a PHP framework that offers a bunch of features. Using Inertia.js allows us to seamlessly integrate our frontend and backend within a single Laravel project. Here is an example of a Laravel setup with React.js using Vite and Inertia.js.

> This setup includes pre-set atomic design patterns and pre-installed Chakra UI.
